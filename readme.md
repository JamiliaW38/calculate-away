#Calculator Pioneer

Remember function syntax and invocation:
````
var whatIsThis = function (string){
	return "This is a " + string;
}; //note this semicolon--not a comma like in methods.

whatIsThis("calculator"); //"This is a calculator"
````

This exercise is supposed to be tedious. Understanding the structure and syntax of functions will yield a better understanding of function declarations and, later, higher order functions.

###Add
* [ ] create a function called "add" that takes two number arguments and returns their sum.

* [ ] create a function called "addAll" that takes an array as an argument, and returns the sum of all the array's values. You MUST use the previously declared function "add".

###Subtract
* [ ] create a function called "subtract" that takes two number arguments and returns their difference.

* [ ] create a function called "diffFrom100" that takes a number argument and returns its difference from 100. You MUST use the previously declared function "subtract".

###Multiply
* [ ] create a function called "multiply" that takes two number arguments and returns their product.

* [ ] create a function called "getTip" that takes in two number arguments and returns 15% of the amount. You MUST use the previously declared function "multiply".

###Divide
* [ ] create a function called "divide" that takes in two number arguments and returns their quotient.

* [ ] create a function called "getHalf" that takes in a number argument and returns its half. You MUST use the previously declared function "divide".

###More practice
* [ ] create a function called "isPositive" which takes in a number argument and returns `true` if the number is greater than 0. Else, it returns false.

* [ ] create a function called "getRemainder" which takes in two number arguments and returns the remainder of the first argument divided by the second. (Search "modulo")

**Are you getting the results you want?**

* [ ] invoke all of your functions with proper arguments.
